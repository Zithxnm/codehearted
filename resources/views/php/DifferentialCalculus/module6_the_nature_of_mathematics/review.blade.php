                <h2>📘 Learning Materials & Core Lesson</h2>

                <h3>1. What is Mathematics?</h3>
                <p>Mathematics comes from the Greek word <strong>“mathema”</strong>, meaning knowledge, study, or learning. 
                   Mathematics is often perceived as the study of numbers, symbols, formulas, and calculations. However, its nature goes far beyond arithmetic. 
                   It is a science of patterns and relationships both abstract (numbers, functions) and real (nature, economy, and society). 
                   From ancient counting systems to modern-day algorithms, mathematics has always been the foundation of knowledge, science, and human progress.</p>

                <h3>2. Characteristics of Mathematics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deals with symbols, numbers, and concepts rather than tangible objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logical:</strong> Built on reasoning, deduction, and proof.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precise:</strong> Provides exact results through clear definitions and rules.</li>
                    <li><strong>Universal:</strong> Serves as a common language understood across cultures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Continuously expanding with new discoveries and applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Roles of Mathematics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>As a Language:</strong> Communicates ideas through numbers, equations, and graphs.</li>
                    <li><strong>As a Tool:</strong> Applied in science, engineering, business, medicine, and daily decision-making.</li>
                    <li><strong>As a Way of Thinking:</strong> Develops problem-solving, critical, and analytical skills.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Applications in Real Life</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Used in budgeting, managing expenses, and calculating interest rates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Architecture:</strong> Involves measurements, design, and geometry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Displays mathematical patterns such as Fibonacci sequences and symmetry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Relies on mathematics for algorithms, artificial intelligence, and cryptography.</li>
                </ul>
